Hey everyone! I'm excited to share a special design project I recently completed. This poster is for **AGNEYA**, the College Day event hosted by the **Navodhan College Union 23-24** at **Sree Gokulam Medical College & Research Foundation**.

For this piece, I drew inspiration from the retro vibes of the Malayalam film poster **Marunadan Retro**, infusing it with vibrant colors and intricate patterns to capture the festive spirit of our college event. The rich greens, bold typography, and ornate border work together to give it a classic yet energetic feel.

Designing this poster was a fun challenge, combining traditional and modern elements to create something unique for our college community.

I hope you enjoy this look into my creative process! Your support helps me continue to explore and share my art. Thank you for being here with me!
