description: The logo is more than just an image‚Äîit's an exploration of how we
  see the world through our lenses. Each wall in the logo is adorned with
  various photos, creating a cube-like space that invites the viewer to step
  inside and see things from multiple perspectives. The different angles and
  orientations of these photos signify the diversity in how moments and memories
  are captured, highlighting how photography allows us to see the ordinary in
  extraordinary ways.

‚ú® I‚Äôm excited to share the logo I designed for our college's photography Instagram page, ‚ÄúPerspective.‚Äù This design was brought to life using Procreate, where I played with the concept of perspective lines to visually represent the art of photography and the unique viewpoints it captures.

The logo is more than just an image‚Äîit's an exploration of how we see the world through our lenses. Each wall in the logo is adorned with various photos, creating a cube-like space that invites the viewer to step inside and see things from multiple perspectives. The different angles and orientations of these photos signify the diversity in how moments and memories are captured, highlighting how photography allows us to see the ordinary in extraordinary ways.

Working on this logo was a creative journey that pushed me to think about space, depth, and the infinite possibilities that photography offers. I wanted the design to not only serve as a logo but also to evoke a sense of curiosity, encouraging viewers to look deeper and think about what they see from different viewpoints.

If this logo resonates with you or if you‚Äôre interested in seeing more of my creative process, from digital drawings to design concepts, I‚Äôd love for you to check out my other works on Patreon. Your support helps fuel my passion for creating unique visual stories! Thank you for being a part of this creative adventure.
