I created this poster for the "**Kanmani Anbodu**" program, hosted by the Navodhan College Union at Sree Gokulam Medical College. The artwork was designed using **Procreate**.

### INSPIRATION

The inspiration for this poster comes from the background score of the Tamil movie "**96**," where the sounds of a whale and a sparrow symbolize a love that exists but cannot be together. I chose this theme to represent the many relationships where people cannot be together due to their circumstances. This poster is dedicated to all those who experience such connections.

### ABOUT

The poster features a harmonious blend of illustrations, including a whale and a sparrow surrounded by blooming flowers, capturing the essence of longing and separation. The earthy tones and organic shapes emphasize the natural beauty and emotional depth of such relationships. The typography is bold and expressive, highlighting the theme "**Kanmani Anbodu**" and making it visually striking and memorable.
