  Bench offers. The silhouettes on the bench could be any of us, lost in thought
  or caught up in a moment with a friend. For me, it‚Äôs a reminder of those
  simpler times when we could just sit, breathe, and enjoy the company of those

Hey everyone! I‚Äôm really excited to share this latest magazine cover I created for **Navodhan 22-23 at Sree Gokulam Medical College & Research Foundation**. This piece is called "**‡¥á‡¥®‡µç‡¥®‡¥≤‡¥ï‡¥≥‡µÅ‡¥ü‡µÜ ‡¥Ö‡¥ü‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡¥Ç ‡¥™‡¥±‡¥ö‡µç‡¥ö‡¥ø‡µΩ**" (which means "The Burial of Yesterdays"), and it‚Äôs inspired by a very special place on our campus the Pride Bench.

If you‚Äôve ever been there, you know exactly what I‚Äôm talking about. It‚Äôs more than just a bench under some trees; it‚Äôs a place where we‚Äôve laughed until we cried, shared our deepest thoughts, and made countless memories with friends. Whether it was escaping the chaos of classes for a few minutes of peace or gathering together to celebrate or console, that bench saw it all. I wanted to capture that feeling of nostalgia, warmth, and all those unspoken stories that this place holds.

In this artwork, I tried to bring that atmosphere to life the quiet of the trees, the soft shade, the sense of calm and reflection that the Pride Bench offers. The silhouettes on the bench could be any of us, lost in thought or caught up in a moment with a friend. For me, it‚Äôs a reminder of those simpler times when we could just sit, breathe, and enjoy the company of those around us.

I hope this piece resonates with you, especially if you‚Äôve had your own "Pride Bench" moments.
