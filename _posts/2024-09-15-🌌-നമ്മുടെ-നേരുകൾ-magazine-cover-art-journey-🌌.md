Hey everyone! I'm super excited to share something close to my heart the cover I created for the upcoming magazine of the **Navodhan 23-24 (2020 batch) at Sree Gokulam Medical College & Research Foundation**.

The magazine is called "**‡¥®‡¥Æ‡µç‡¥Æ‡µÅ‡¥ü‡µÜ ‡¥®‡µá‡¥∞‡µÅ‡¥ï‡µæ**" (Our Truth), and for this cover, I wanted to capture a sense of nostalgia and wonder. The inspiration came from a photo my friend took of our college building, set against a quiet night sky filled with stars. That image really stuck with me, and I knew I wanted to recreate that feeling of looking up, feeling small yet part of something bigger. So, I grabbed my iPad, opened Procreate, and started drawing.

I tried to stay true to the original photo, but I also wanted to add a bit of magic to it. The deep purples and blues of the sky are meant to evoke a dreamy, almost surreal atmosphere, while the stars give it a sense of calm and infinite possibilities. The college building, which I carefully hand-drew, serves as a familiar anchor it's our home away from home, after all. The vibrant title design, "‡¥®‡¥Æ‡µç‡¥Æ‡µÅ‡¥ü‡µÜ ‡¥®‡µá‡¥∞‡µÅ‡¥ï‡µæ," with its bold, dynamic brushstrokes, aims to capture the spirit of our stories and experiences, all coming together in this magazine. And of course, I couldn‚Äôt forget the greenery that surrounds our campus‚Äîthose little touches of nature add a comforting sense of place and belonging.

This cover is more than just an illustration to me; it's a blend of memories, feelings, and the unique energy of our college community. I hope it brings back some of your own memories and makes you feel the warmth and connection we all share.

Thank you for being here and supporting my creative journey. Your encouragement means the world to me! Stay tuned for more art, stories, and maybe even a few sneak peeks behind the scenes.
