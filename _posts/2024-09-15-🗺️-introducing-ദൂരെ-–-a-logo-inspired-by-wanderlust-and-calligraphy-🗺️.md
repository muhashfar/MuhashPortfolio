description: When designing this logo, I wanted to bring together the charm of
  Malayalam calligraphy with a touch of modern flair. I aimed to capture that
  feeling of setting off on a new adventure, the excitement of venturing into
  the unknown. The white textured lettering stands out against a moody sunset
  backdrop, creating a sense of depth and wanderlust perfect for a travel page
  that inspires journeys beyond the horizon.

Hey everyone! I‚Äôm thrilled to share something new from my design desk a logo I created for the travel page "**Dhoore**" on Instagram, known by the handle *@\_dhoore\_*. "Dhoore," which means "Far Away" in Malayalam, is a page that celebrates the joy of exploration and the beauty of far-off places.

When designing this logo, I wanted to bring together the charm of Malayalam calligraphy with a touch of modern flair. I aimed to capture that feeling of setting off on a new adventure, the excitement of venturing into the unknown. The white textured lettering stands out against a moody sunset backdrop, creating a sense of depth and wanderlust perfect for a travel page that inspires journeys beyond the horizon.

Every curve and line in this calligraphy is meant to reflect the unpredictable yet beautiful paths we take when we travel, the roads less traveled, and the stories waiting to be discovered. The fluid style represents the flow of a journey, with all its twists, turns, and surprises.
